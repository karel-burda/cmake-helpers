# Introduction
`cmake-helpers` features tiny cmake-related functions and macros I'm using across my projects based on CMake.

See [cmake-helpers](cmake-helpers) for main functionality and [tests/unit](tests/unit) for unit tests.

# Build Process
For generation of project containing the implementation and tests, run the cmake in the top-level directory like this:

`cmake .`

I personally prefer to specify a separate build directory explicitly:

`cmake -Bbuild -H.`

You can of course specify ordinary cmake options like build type (debug, release with debug info, ...), used generator, etc.

# Tests
For running unit and integration tests, execute

`cmake . -DRUN_UNIT_TESTS:BOOL=ON -DRUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS:BOOL=OFF`

Tests are being run in the Continuous Integration environment.
